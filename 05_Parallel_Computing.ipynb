Eventually, the IPython engine will be a full IPython interpreter, but for now, it is a regular Python interpreter. The engine can also handle incoming and outgoing Python objects sent over a network connection. When multiple engines are started, parallel and distributed computing becomes possible. An important feature of an IPython engine is that it blocks while user code is being executed."

These Schedulers are typically run in separate processes but on the same machine as the Hub, but can be run anywhere from local threads or on remote machines.\n",

In IPython, all of these models are implemented via the View.apply() method, after constructing View objects to represent subsets of engines. The two primary models for interacting with engines are:\n",
